It wasn't just me.

01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,371
What did Kikuo say?

1011
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:49,832
That he forced you
to be his accomplice.

1012

-He did? [laughs]

So why did you do it?

1017
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:05,348
I needed to help him.

1018

No. But I asked her
if I could visit you.

I can go, if you want.

Why do adults always lie?

1059
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,776
It's because it's a lot easier
than telling the truth.

1060
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,404
Sometimes they lie
